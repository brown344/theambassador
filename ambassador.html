<h1 class="subtitle">Our History</h1>
<p class="text1">On January 1, 1965, the Ambassador Restaurant<br>opened under new ownership. The new owners,<br>the Rossi family, had transformed the space<br>from a tap bar into a restaurant that specialized<br>in pizza and sandwiches. In 1978, the<br>Ambassador was expanded into the space next<br>door, and the second dining room was added.<br>In January 2007, the Ambassador became a non-<br>smoking establishment. To explain the history of<br>the Ambassador and the unique murals that line<br>the interior walls, the owners conducted<br>research and wrote a poem detailing the story.<br>The poem, entitled "Come Fill a Bumper," has<br>since been printed on the cover of the<br>Ambassador menu (see below for full text).<br>The first line of the poem mentions "Mr.<br>Rohrbeck," who was “given a job to do.”<br>Rohrbeck, the mural artist, was commissioned</p>
<p class="text2"> by Joseph Bosch (born in Baden, Germany in<br>1850) to paint the murals specifically for the<br>Bosch brewery (closed in 1978).<br>The murals were later placed in the "old Giltedge<br>Bar." Featuring gnomes in various states of<br>celebration, the murals are oil on canvas, with<br>several coats of varnish on top for preservation.<br>The date that the paintings were sold to the<br>Ambassador and transferred from the Bosch<br>Brewery is unclear, but the transaction likely took<br>place in the late 40s or early 50s during a<br>remodeling project. The Ambassador retains the<br>original charm and tradition of its original inception;<br>in addition to the murals, which have remained in<br>place for over 50 years, the original pizza recipe is<br>still used to create the Ambassador pizzas.

<h1 class="subsubtitle">Come Fill a Bumper</h1>
<p class="poem">On or about nineteen hundred and two, Mr. Rohrbeck was given a job to do.<br>
With brushes in hand and gnomes in his head, he created the masterpiece on the wall above.<br>
First home for the paintings was the old Giltedge Bar, east of here, but not too far.<br>
Streets were of dirt, sidewalks of wood, hitching posts for horses, business was good.<br>
Beer for a nickel, whiskey for a dime, sandwiches a quarter any old time.<br>
Prohibition was next, and became the law, the Ambassador, a speakeasy, called<br>“Hole in the Wall”<br>
Paintings were rolled and stored away, for twelve long years in the dust they lay.<br>
At last came nineteen thirty-three, the law was repealed and Bacchus was free.<br>
Saloons and taverns opened their doors, folks danced, sang, and drank spirits once<br>more.<br>
The old bar was hauled out of its storage place, and the paintings were hung on the walls they now<br>grace.<br>
The artist, long gone, would be proud if he knew, that folks still enjoy them as much<br>as they do.</p>
